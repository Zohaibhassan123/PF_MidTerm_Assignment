2. Define any two from the following:

a- Header files
b- Source code
c- Comments

solution:

a) header files:
A header file is a file that contains reusable code such as function prototypes, definitions, constants, and macros, which can be included in a program using #include.
example:
#include <iostream> // header file for input/output functions like cout, cin.

b) Source code:
Source code is the human-readable set of instructions written by a programmer using a programming language such as C++, Java, Python, etc. This language is not direct understood by computer it has to be converted into machine code before execution.

c)Comments:
Comments are notes written inside a program to explain what the code does.
They are ignored by the compiler, meaning they do not affect the program's output.
There are two types of comments:
sinale line comments
// This is a single-line comment
cout << "Hello":
multi line comments
/* This is a
multi-line comment */
cout << "Hello";
